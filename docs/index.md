### Download and Install

You can download the latest release of TrialManager from the [releases page](https://github.com/carlst99/TrialManager/releases/latest/). Download and install the `Setup.exe` file.

TrialManager will then keep itself up-to-date automatically, provided you open it while connected to the internet. 
If unsure, you can always compare the version in the `About` menu with the latest release on the releases page
### Diagnostics Acceptance

On the first-time run, TrialManager will ask you if you wish to report diagnostics data to the developer.
We recommend that you leave diagnostics enabled, as it allows us to easily fix issues that TrialManager may encounter while operating.
Note that you can change your decision regarding diagnostics at any time by accessing the about menu.
