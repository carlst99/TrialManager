# TrialManager

### Download and Install

You can download the latest release of TrialManager from the [releases page](https://github.com/carlst99/TrialManager/releases).

Once the file finishes downloading, you can install it like any other app.
**You will need [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime) or higher install to run TrialManager**. If in doubt, download the *x86 version* of .NET Core.
You will also need to be running **Windows 10**, version 1607 or higher. You can check this in `Settings->System->About`
TrialManager will then keep itself up-to-date automatically, provided you open it while connected to the internet. 
If unsure, you can always compare the version in the `About` menu with the latest release on the releases page

!!! note
	Windows Smartscreen may occasionally warn you that the file you are trying to install is not commonly downloaded.
	This is normal behaviour and can be ignored.

### Diagnostics Acceptance

We recommend that you leave diagnostics enabled, as it allows us to easily fix issues that TrialManager may encounter while operating.
