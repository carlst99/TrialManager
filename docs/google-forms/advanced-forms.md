### Adding Phone/Mail Entries

Occasionally, we've found that some trialists simply cannot fill out an online form. Sometimes people are scared of the new format, but generally with strong encouragement we've found them to overcome that barrier and their feedback is positive. 

However, the most common reason that people cannot use the online form is that they simply don't have access to an internet-connected device. In this case, they'll have to resort back to the old standard of phone/mail entry. **Any entries performed in this way will need to be added to what you have collected online** - there are two ways of achieving this.

1. Go through the online entry form yourself, but enter the details they have given you over the phone/mail. This option works well and can be done easily anywhere, but can be more time consuming for large numbers of manual entries
2. After entries have closed and you have downloaded the CSV file, you can add each entry into the file (see [editing entries](download-edit-entries.md#editing-the-entries-in-excelgoogle-sheets))

### Reusing Forms

Google Forms makes it easy to re-use the forms that you have already created. This means that you can simply update anything that has changed, such as date and address, while keeping the same questions as the last form. You can do this in two ways.

1. **Clear all the responses on an existing form**, and [distribute](#distributing-your-form) it again. This is the recommended method. Just remember to clear the responses each time you want to use it for a new trial!

2. **Make a copy of the form**, and [distribute](#distributing-your-form) the new copy

You can combine these methods to create one form per trial. Start by creating one entry form, then copy and adjust it for each trial that you would normally run in a year. Then, you can reuse each form every year by clearing the previous years responses.
