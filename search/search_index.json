The simplest and most convenient way to achieve this (with guaranteed TrialManager compatibility!) is to create a Google Form. Using one form for multiple events \u00b6 Stub Adding Phone/Mail Entries \u00b6 Occasionally, we've found that some trialists simply cannot fill out an online form. Sometimes people are scared of the new format, but generally with strong encouragement we've found them to overcome that barrier and their feedback is positive. However, the most common reason that people cannot use the online form is that they simply don't have access to an internet-connected device. In this case, they'll have to resort back to the old standard of phone/mail entry. Any entries performed in this way will need to be added to what you have collected online - there are two ways of achieving this. Go through the online entry form yourself, but enter the details they have given you over the phone/mail. This option works well and can be done easily anywhere, but can be more time consuming for large numbers of manual entries After entries have closed and you have downloaded the CSV file, you can add each entry into the file (see editing entries )","title":"Creating a Google Form"},{"location":"google-forms/create-google-form/#creating-an-entry-form-wip","text":"Creating an online entry form is where it all starts.

Google Forms makes it easy to download one directly. Start by going to Responses tab and disallowing responses - flick the 'Accepting Responses' switch to the off position. Next, click on the 'overflow menu' - the three vertical dots, and select 'Download Responses (.csv)'. Watch the animated image below for a guide on this process. This will download the data as a ZIP file. This is similar to a folder - simply double click on the ZIP file to open it and access the CSV file. At this point we recommend extracting the CSV file from the ZIP package, by right-clicking the ZIP file and selecting 'Extract All'. After this process is complete you can safely delete the ZIP file. Note We recommend that you only download the entries once they have closed, so that you don't confuse yourself with multiple datasets. Editing the entries in Excel/Google Sheets \u00b6 Quite often, you'll want to edit the entries, or at least browse through them in a more compact manner than what you can do in Google Forms. Reasons for doing this include: Fixing incorrect entries To add phone/mail entries Separating multiple events into different csv files Editing in Excel \u00b6 Start by downloading the CSV file. From here, you can simply open it in Excel. Note that when saving, Excel might warn you that saving as CSV could result in losing some features. Ignore this, as no data will be lost. Editing in Google Sheets \u00b6 Start by exporting the entries from Google Forms. To do this, open the Responses tab of your Google Form, and click the Create Spreadsheet button. This will create a Sheets project in your Google Drive. After you have editing your entries, you will need to download them from Sheets. To do this, go to the File menu.
