Take the 2020 King Country Centre Championships; said trial ran Shorthead, longhead, Zigzag hunt and Straight hunt events. Although creating a different form for each event is a perfectly valid strategy, we don't recommend it; this confuses participants and creates more work for you. Setting up the form \u00b6 Currently, our recommended method for condensing multiple events into one entry form is as follows: Add a Title and Description \"question\", informing your users to fill out the form separately for each event that they want to enter Add a Multiple Choice question that allows your users to select the event that they are filling out the form for Click the settings icon in the top-right corner. In the menu that appears, go to the Presentation tab. Under the Confirmation Message section, write something along the lines of \"If you wish to enter another event, please fill out this form again by re-clicking the link\" Below: What your form should look like after steps 1 and 2 Below: Setting the confirmation message Formatting the data [WIP] \u00b6 Using the above technique does result in one hitch - each event will be placed into the same CSV file. You will need to separate each event into a separate file so that TrialManager can do its job. Start by getting your data into a place where you can edit it - see Editing Entries Adding Phone/Mail Entries \u00b6 Occasionally, we've found that some trialists simply cannot fill out an online form. Sometimes people are scared of the new format, but generally with strong encouragement we've found them to overcome that barrier and their feedback is positive. However, the most common reason that people cannot use the online form is that they simply don't have access to an internet-connected device. In this case, they'll have to resort back to the old standard of phone/mail entry. Any entries performed in this way will need to be added to what you have collected online - there are two ways of achieving this. Go through the online entry form yourself, but enter the details they have given you over the phone/mail. This option works well and can be done easily anywhere, but can be more time consuming for large numbers of manual entries After entries have closed and you have downloaded the CSV file, you can add each entry into the file (see editing entries ) Reusing Forms \u00b6 Google Forms makes it easy to re-use the forms that you have already created. This means that you can simply update anything that has changed, such as date and address, while keeping the same questions as the last form. You can do this in two ways. Clear all the responses on an existing form , and distribute it again. This is the recommended method. Just remember to clear the responses each time you want to use it for a new trial! Make a copy of the form , and distribute the new copy You can combine these methods to create one form per trial. Start by creating one entry form, then copy and adjust it for each trial that you would normally run in a year. Then, you can reuse each form every year by clearing the previous years responses.","title":"Advanced Form Techniques"},{"location":"google-forms/advanced-forms/#advanced-form-techniques-wip","text":"","title":"Advanced Form Techniques [WIP]"},{"location":"google-forms/advanced-forms/#using-one-form-for-multiple-events","text":"Pretty much every trial will have multiple events.

The simplest and most convenient way to achieve this (with guaranteed TrialManager compatibility!) is to create a Google Form. For guidance on creating and editing a Google Form, please read Google's own documentation . Basic Requirements \u00b6 Generally, you'll want your form to display information such as date, address, contact/payment info and important details such as dog clearance requirements. Furthermore, you may want to collect the participant's contact info and specify any other guidelines relevant to the entry. However, there are some data points that you must collect for TrialManager to operate . TrialManager calls these 'properties'. Above: An example of providing trial info and collecting participant contact info TrialManager Required Properties \u00b6 TrialManager requires, at a minimum, the: full name, status, first dog name from each trialist. We recommend that you use the Short Answer question type for names and the Multiple Choice question type for the status. You will need to mark these questions as Required so that participants cannot skip them. Note Each property must be put in its own question so that TrialManager can correctly recognise them TrialManager Optional Properties \u00b6 TrialManager also accepts a number of properties that can enhance the draw creation process. Each property requires its own question . The optional properties are: Address, used to sort Trialists into the draw based on their distance to the trial grounds Preferred day (see notes) Dog Two-Five Name (Use separate questions for each!) Dog One-Five Status (Use separate questions for each!) Preferred Day Notes \u00b6 It is imperative that you use the Multiple Choice question type when giving the entry form a Preferred Day option. This is because TrialManager cannot directly parse written dates, and therefore requires you to 'map' your written date to one that it can understand. Hence, if you give participants the option of writing in their own date, you will have to map tens, possibly hundreds of the different written dates that people enter. Your preferred day question should look similar to below: Distributing your form \u00b6 Now that we've created a basic form, we need to send it to prospective trialists. The best way to do this is to get a link to the form and distribute via email, Facebook etc. To obtain a link, click the purple 'Send' button in the top-right corner of your form's design page. Switch to the link tab and copy/paste the provided link into an email or social media post.

Google Forms makes it easy to download one directly. Start by going to Responses tab and disallowing responses - flick the 'Accepting Responses' switch to the off position. Next, click on the 'overflow menu' - the three vertical dots, and select 'Download Responses (.csv)'. Watch the animated image below for a guide on this process. This will download the data as a ZIP file. This is similar to a folder - simply double click on the ZIP file to open it and access the CSV file. At this point we recommend extracting the CSV file from the ZIP package, by right-clicking the ZIP file and selecting 'Extract All'. After this process is complete you can safely delete the ZIP file. Note We recommend that you only download the entries once they have closed, so that you don't confuse yourself with multiple datasets. Important Do not disallow responses if you wish to continue collecting them! We only put this into the docs as per the above recommendation. Editing the entries in Excel/Google Sheets \u00b6 Quite often, you'll want to edit the entries, or at least browse through them in a more compact manner than what you can do in Google Forms. Reasons for doing this include: Fixing incorrect entries To add phone/mail entries Separating multiple events into different csv files Editing in Excel \u00b6 Start by downloading the CSV file. From here, you can simply open it in Excel. Note that when saving, Excel might warn you that saving as CSV could result in losing some features. Ignore this, as no data will be lost. Editing in Google Sheets \u00b6 Start by exporting the entries from Google Forms. To do this, open the Responses tab of your Google Form, and click the Create Spreadsheet button. This will create a Sheets project in your Google Drive. After you have editing your entries, you will need to download them from Sheets. To do this, go to the File menu.
