# TrialManager
TrialManager is a solution for New Zealand sheepdog trialing clubs that accelerates and eases the process of making draws for their trials.

It uses data from a CSV file, generally downloaded from Google Forms, and sorts trialists into a draw based on certain parameters, such as their preferred day and distance to the trial grounds.
