# TrialManager
TrialManager helps NZ sheepdog trialing clubs to create draws for their trials.
It uses data from a CSV file, generally downloaded from Google Forms, and sorts trialists into a draw based on certain parameters, such as their preferred day and distance to the trial grounds.

TrialManager currently only works on Windows computers with a .NET Core 3.1 runtime.

### Important :warning:
TrialManager is still in development and is undergoing regular, significant feature changes. Furthermore, it is not fully hand or unit tested and should therefore be considered unreliable.
**Nor is it licensed properly**. Please use only if you understand what you are doing.

### Roadmap
I intend to release TrialManager only when I am confident that all features work properly and it is customisable to the extent that it will fulfil the requirements of most different trial formats.
This means a significant amount of work and testing is required before I start work on release features like installers and documentation.
