# TrialManager
TrialManager is a solution for New Zealand sheepdog trialing clubs that accelerates and eases the process of making draws for their trials.

It uses data from a CSV file, generally downloaded from Google Forms, and sorts trialists into a draw based on certain parameters, such as their preferred day and distance to the trial grounds.

### Important :warning:
TrialManager is still in development and is not fully hand or unit tested and should therefore be considered unreliable. Furthermore, documentation is at a minimum. You are welcome to install TrialManager and try it out, however be aware that it may not perform as expected.
